# Flashcards App

Learn faster using flashcards with Leitner system!

## About

It's my first android app I've ever created. The code is very messy - I had no idea about clean code practices (I'm working on it), I'm using mixed polish and english in app. 
I hope in near future I will be able to refactor this code, make it more clean and add some features. 

## About app itself

Aplication is based on Leitner system - when flashcard is added it goes to section 1. When you test yourself, and know the answer, card is pushed to section 2, and so on. If you dont know the answer, flaschcard drops one section.
